# Svelte + TS + Vite

## Lighthall #2 round 1 challenge

### Food Truck Map

> Create a service that tells the user what types of food trucks might be found near a specific location on a map.
> Please submit a link to a hosted web app. The data is available on DataSF: https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat

- can't figure out how to add Tailwind to just a front end svelte app, I'm not wasting any more time on it.

### extras:

- add types to leaflet variables and fetched data
- add custom icons depending on the type of food (question mark for no info, taco for tacos, etc.)
- add loading spinner while data is fetching
