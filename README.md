# Svelte + TS + Vite

## Lighthall #2 round 1 challenge

### Food Truck Map

> Create a service that tells the user what types of food trucks might be found near a specific location on a map.
> Please submit a link to a hosted web app. The data is available on DataSF: https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat

- can't figure out how to add Tailwind to just a front end svelte app, I'm not wasting any more time on it.

### TODOS:

- make leaflet map ui
- add food truck markers to ui
- allow for user to search based on their location
- display the types of food the truck has from the api
